    "When we are finished typing and press Shift+Enter, the notebook runs our command. Since we haven’t told it to do anything else with the function’s output, the notebook displays it. In this case, that output is the data we just loaded. By default, only a few rows and columns are shown (with ... to omit elements when displaying big arrays). To save space, Python displays numbers as 1. instead of 1.0 when there’s nothing interesting after the decimal point.\n",

    "Our call to __`pandas.read_csv`__ read our file, but didn’t save the data in memory. To do that, we need to assign the array to a variable. A variable is just a name for a value, such as __`x`__, __`current_temperature`__, or __`subject_id`__. Python’s variables must begin with a letter and are case sensitive. We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using =. As an illustration, let’s step back and instead of considering a table of data, consider the simplest “collection” of data, a single value. The line below assigns the value __55__ to a variable __`weight_kg`__:"
