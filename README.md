The Curtin Institute for Computation is organising a Python workshop.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful general-purpose programming language that is very popular in scientific computing and data analysis.

This workshop is aimed at beginners and will teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on. This introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: analyse a dataset.

The workshop is available free of charge to Curtin students and staff. Please forward the information to anyone you think might be interested.
